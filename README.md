## Introduction
THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS
During the second half of XXth Century, science had a turning point specially through a knowledge industry from US Universities, a scientific reference for Western Civilization. This was also true for Social Sciences and for Political Science.

From US Universities, political science started to work with more objective concerns that could be quantified, reproduced and verified. Logical dilemmas, Simulations and statistical modelling were the main instruments used by north-american social sciences. Thus, works as those from Robert Dahl marked a generation. Dahl made a complex model to stratify nations by their democracy level, using the tools he had available.

We tried a more humble exercise here based on Dahl's effort, also using the tools we've available today. We simply did web scraping to collect all Constitutions available in English. Further, we cleaned the data, tokenized it, did a stemmatization, applied tfidf and used Kmeans algorithm to clusterize the constitutions.

So, we have a graph which cluster countries by constitutional text similarity. It's far from perfect and we didn't achieve close to reality. We've some problems yet to solve:

1) We need to debug and extract 20 Constitutions from important countries such as Germany that we couldn't automatize;
2) Stemmatization didn't seem to work here. This happened before and from our experience sometimes it's better not to apply stem and you get a better result;
3) We want to apply a Supervised or Semi-Supervised Model, such as XGBoost and CNN with BERT, or maybe Topic Modelling. We would like to try to add labels such type of government (parlamentarism, presidentialism, semi-presidentialism, absolutist monarchy, constitutional democracy), another label if it's a Republic or an Autocracy and another label by number of parties.

LET'S KEEP THE GOOD WORK!
